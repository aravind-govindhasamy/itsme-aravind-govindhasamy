    "bio": "Vanakkam, nanba! Your local backend software developer—just like a good idli, I’m soft on the outside but packed with tech goodness inside! My specialty? \n Cooking up IoT RFID solutions faster than my amma can whip up a sambar! \n I’m well-versed in the languages of the tech world: Node.js, C#, Python, SQL, and API—like a proper South Indian can handle both vada and dosa! My experience with RFID technology and MySQL stored procedures has made me the ‘Saar’ of coding. \n Always ready to explore new avenues in cybersecurity and IoT, I tackle challenges like a Tamil hero taking on villains in a masala film—full of energy and a bit of drama! With my solid educational background and a love for technology, I’m excited to connect, share some laughs, and maybe enjoy a plate of biryani together!",
